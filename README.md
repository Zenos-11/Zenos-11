# Hello there!


Although I'm not sure which project brought you to my homepage, but welcome! I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science, diligently studying various computer-related knowledge. The sheer number of computer terminologies is vast, and the array of technology stacks has far exceeded my imagination. I am actively exploring all of this and striving to become the geek of my dreams!
